# JFaceDetection
Java implementation of opencv to successfully detect the faces of individuals. 
The code is performed in eclipse workspace. You should include the OpenCV's executable jar file (with x64 DLL file) while performing run configuration in eclipse. Here, we need not to use Maven to implement this.
